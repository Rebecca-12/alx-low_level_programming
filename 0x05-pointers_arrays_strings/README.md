# C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This project focuses on developing a solid understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. It comprises a series of tasks that cover various aspects of these foundational concepts. Each task involves implementing C functions to perform specific operations, helping you gain insight into how pointers, arrays, and strings work in C.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will achieve the following learning objectives:

- Grasp the concept of pointers: Understand what pointers are and how to use them to access and modify data indirectly via memory addresses.
- Manipulate arrays: Learn how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays of different data types.
- Work with strings: Acquire techniques to manipulate strings, including copying, reversing, and printing.
- Practice proper function implementation: Write functions that adhere to the project's requirements and follow the specified style guidelines (Betty style).
- Output with : Utilize the provided  function to output characters and digits.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several tasks, each requiring the implementation of a specific C function. The tasks include:

1. **98 Battery st.**: Implement a function to update the value pointed to by an integer pointer to 98.
2. **Don't swap horses in crossing a stream**: Write a function to swap the values of two integers.
3. **This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read**: Create a function to calculate the length of a string.
4. **I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them**: Implement a function to print a string followed by a new line.
5. **I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear**: Write a function to print a string in reverse order.
6. **Half the lies they tell about me aren't true**: Create a function to print every other character of a string.
7. **Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half**: Implement a function to print the second half of a string.
8. **Arrays are not pointers**: Write a function to print a specified number of elements from an integer array.
9. **strcpy**: Create a function to copy a string from one buffer to another.

## Usage

1. Each task requires implementing a specific C function as described in the task description.
2. Compile your C code using  with the provided  file and any necessary header files.
3. Execute the compiled program to see the results of your implemented functions.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation using  on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with options 
- Each C file should end with a newline
- Adhere to the provided  header file and the Betty style guidelines
- Avoid using global variables
- Implement the required functions, respecting the function prototypes and task requirements

## Credits

This project is part of the ALX - Holberton School curriculum, designed to teach students the fundamentals of programming and software development in C.
