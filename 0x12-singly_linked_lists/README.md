## Introduction

Singly linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science. They consist of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of singly linked lists in C and includes functions to perform various operations on them.

## Project Requirements

The project adheres to the following requirements:

- All code is written in C.
- Coding style follows the Betty style guide.
- Use of specific C standard library functions is restricted.
- No use of global variables.
- Each function file contains no more than 5 functions.
- Proper documentation and function prototypes in a header file.

## Tasks

The project includes several tasks, each of which focuses on a specific operation related to singly linked lists. These tasks include:

1. Printing elements of a singly linked list.
2. Counting the number of elements in a linked list.
3. Adding a new node to the beginning of a linked list.
4. Adding a new node to the end of a linked list.
5. Freeing memory allocated for a linked list.
6. Advanced tasks (optional).

## Usage

To compile and run the programs in this project, you can use the following commands (replace `<filename>` with the appropriate file name):

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 <filename.c> -o <output_name>
./<output_name>
