# 0x08. C - Recursion

## Description
This repository contains solutions to the tasks related to recursion in the C programming language. The tasks cover various aspects of recursion, from basic concepts to more complex problem-solving scenarios.

## Learning Objectives
By completing the tasks in this project, you will:
- Understand the concept of recursion and its implementation.
- Learn when recursion is suitable and when it's not appropriate.
- Apply recursion to solve different types of problems.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of recursion. The tasks are as follows:
- Task 0: `_puts_recursion.c` - Print a string using recursion.
- Task 1: `_print_rev_recursion.c` - Print a string in reverse \using recursion.
- Task 2: `_strlen_recursion.c` - Calculate the length of a string using recursion.
- Task 3: `factorial.c` - Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.
- Task 4: `_pow_recursion.c` - Calculate the power of a number using recursion.
- Task 5: `_sqrt_recursion.c` - Calculate the square root of a number using recursion.
- Task 6: `is_prime_number.c` - Check if a number is prime using recursion.
- Task 100: `is_palindrome.c` - Check if a string is a palindrome using recursion.
- Task 101: `wildcmp.c` - Compare two strings with a wildcard using recursion.

## Getting Started
To compile the code for each task, you can use the provided compilation commands in the task descriptions. For testing, run the compiled executable and observe the output.

## Requirements
- The code follows the Betty style guidelines for formatting.
- No global variables are used in the solutions.
- Each task's prototype is defined in the `main.h` header file.

## Quiz Questions
Great! You've completed the quiz successfully! Keep going!
