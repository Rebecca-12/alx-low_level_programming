Singly Linked List Project
#Overview
The Singly Linked List Project is a collection of C programming tasks focused on working with singly linked lists. In computer science, a singly linked list is a fundamental data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each containing a value and a reference (or link) to the next element in the sequence. These tasks aim to help you understand and practice the manipulation of linked lists, including various operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

#Table of Contents
The project includes several tasks, each designed to address a specific aspect of singly linked lists. The tasks are as follows:


0. Print list: Create a function to print all the elements of a linked list.
1. List length: Develop a function to count and return the number of elements in a linked list.
2. Add node: Implement a function to add a new node at the beginning of a linked list.
3. Add node at the end: Create a function to add a new node at the end of a linked list.
4. Free list: Write a function to free the memory allocated for a linked list.
7. Free: Implement a function to free the memory of a single node in the linked list.
8. Pop: Develop a function to delete the head node of a linked list and return its value.
9. Get node at index: Create a function to retrieve the value of a node at a specific index in the linked list.
Sum list: Implement a function to compute the sum of all the elements in a linked list.
10. Insert: Develop a function to insert a new node at a specific position in the linked list.
11. Delete at index: Create a function to delete a node at a specific index in the linked list.
12. Reverse list: Implement a function to reverse the order of elements in the linked list.
13. Print (safe version): Create a safe print function to handle NULL values gracefully.

These tasks progressively build upon each other, allowing you to practice and demonstrate your understanding of linked list manipulation.

#Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need a C development environment, such as GCC, installed on your system. You can clone this repository to access the starter code for each task and complete the functions according to the task descriptions. You can compile and run the provided test programs to verify the correctness of your solutions.
