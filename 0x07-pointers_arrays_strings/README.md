# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays, and strings

This repository contains solutions to tasks that involve pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. The tasks are part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum.

## Files and Directories

* `0-memset.c`: Function that simulates the behavior of the `memset` standard library function.
* `1-memcpy.c`: Function that simulates the behavior of the `memcpy` standard library function.
* `2-strchr.c`: Function that simulates the behavior of the `strchr` standard library function.
* `3-strspn.c`: Function that simulates the behavior of the `strspn` standard library function.
* `4-strpbrk.c`: Function that simulates the behavior of the `strpbrk` standard library function.
* `5-strstr.c`: Function that simulates the behavior of the `strstr` standard library function.
* `7-print_chessboard.c`: Function to print a chessboard pattern using a given matrix of characters.
* `8-print_diagsums.c`: Function to print the sum of the diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
* `100-set_string.c`: Function to set the value of a pointer to a string.
* `101-crackme_password`: A file containing the password for the `crackme2` executable.
