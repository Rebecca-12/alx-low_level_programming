## Description
This project focuses on working with command-line arguments in C programming. It contains several tasks, each requiring the implementation of a C program that performs specific actions using command-line arguments.

## Tasks
1. [Task 0: It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to](./0-whatsmyname.c)
   - Write a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.

2. [Task 1: Silence is argument carried out by other means](./1-args.c)
   - Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.

3. [Task 2: The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter](./2-args.c)
   - Write a program that prints all the arguments it receives.

4. [Task 3: Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument](./3-mul.c)
   - Write a program that multiplies two numbers provided as command-line arguments.

5. [Task 4: To infinity and beyond](./4-add.c)
   - Write a program that adds positive numbers provided as command-line arguments.

## Requirements

* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
* Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
* You are allowed to use the standard library

## How to Use
To compile and run each task, use the following commands:

```shell
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 -o <output_file> <source_file.c>
./<output_file>
