# String Manipulation Tasks

This repository contains a collection of C programs that demonstrate various string manipulation operations. Each program is designed to perform a specific string manipulation task using C programming concepts. The tasks range from concatenating and copying strings to changing the case of letters and encoding strings.

## Table of Contents

- [Task 0: Concatenate Strings](#task-0-concatenate-strings)
- [Task 1: Concatenate with Limit](#task-1-concatenate-with-limit)
- [Task 2: Copy Strings](#task-2-copy-strings)
- [Task 3: Compare Strings](#task-3-compare-strings)
- [Task 4: Reverse Array](#task-4-reverse-array)
- [Task 5: Convert to Uppercase](#task-5-convert-to-uppercase)
- [Task 6: Capitalize Words](#task-6-capitalize-words)
- [Task 7: Encode in 1337](#task-7-encode-in-1337)

## Getting Started

These programs are designed to be compiled and executed using the GCC compiler on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The source code for each task is provided in separate C files.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the appropriate task directory.
3. Compile the source code using the provided compilation command.
4. Run the compiled executable to see the output of the string manipulation operation.

## Function Prototypes

Each task includes a function prototype that specifies the function's input parameters and return type. These prototypes are provided in the `main.h` header file for reference.

## About

This project is part of a series of programming tasks aimed at improving C programming skills. The tasks cover various string manipulation operations, helping developers gain a better understanding of C language features and string handling techniques.
