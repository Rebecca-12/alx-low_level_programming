# File I/O in C - Project

## Description
This project focuses on mastering file input and output (I/O) operations in the C programming language. By implementing various tasks, participants will delve into concepts such as file descriptors, system calls, and handling file permissions. The project emphasizes practical applications of I/O functions like open, close, read, and write, reinforcing a solid understanding of these essential operations.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the role of file descriptors and their relevance in file I/O.
- Learn to use system calls such as open, close, read, and write efficiently.
- Explore the significance of flags like O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, and O_RDWR in file operations.
- Gain insights into setting file permissions during file creation.
- Distinguish between functions and system calls, and comprehend the differences.
- Develop the ability to seek and use the right information online for problem-solving.

## Requirements
- Code should adhere to the Betty style.
- Use allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific options.
- Restriction on global variables and limited C standard library functions.
- Detailed instructions for creating files, file permissions, and proper code organization.
- Task-specific constraints and guidelines provided in each section.

## Tasks
1. **Task 0: Tread lightly, she is near**
   - Implement a function to read a text file and print it to the POSIX standard output.

2. **Task 1: Under the snow**
   - Create a function to create a file with specified permissions and write content.

3. **Task 2: Speak gently, she can hear**
   - Write a function to append text at the end of an existing file.

4. **Task 3: cp**
   - Develop a program to copy the content of one file to another with error handling.

5. **Task 4: elf (Advanced)**
   - Create a program to display information from the ELF header of an ELF file.

## File Structure
The project is organized into separate directories for each task, ensuring clarity and modularity.

## How to Compile
